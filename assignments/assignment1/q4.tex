\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c| } 
 \hline
eps & vanila & adversarial trained  \\ 
\hline
 0.2 & 20/20 & 19/20 \\ 
 0.1 & 12/20 & 9/20 \\ 
 0.05 & 4/20 & 3/20 \\ 
 0.02 & 0/20 & 0/20 \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Observation: Model with adversarial training has fewer labels changed.

Conclusion: Model with adversarial training is more robust.
